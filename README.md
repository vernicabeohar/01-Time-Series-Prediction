# 01-Time-Series-Prediction
Performed Time Series Prediction on road dataset

Problem:

-> Predict data for the 10th year for parameters 9-13

Steps:

-> Split the dataset into Train and Test dataset by extracting 10th year data for parameters 9-13 for every section

-> Applied Extra Regressor Model to implement Random Forest and predicted the corresponding values
